# WordPress-Sites
In this repository, I describe the websites, I develop using WordPress. WordPress is a powerful tool for creating sites easily with plugins' and themes' help. Most of these media are free to use or have financial requirements (usually with a free trial or subscription with limitations). The important thing is that everyone can build a professional site free with WordPress, so I am learning and improving my skills by developing websites.

Each of my sites is hosted in a free InfinityFree account, which has resource limitations. So, if the page is sticking sometimes, that is because I use a free account for each page. About the plugins that I use in WordPress, the most usually are:
1. Elementor (building each page)
2. WooCommerce (for e-commerce parts)
3. Payment Plugins for Stripe WooCommerce (for payment methods)
4. WPForms (contact and any of the forms)
5. WP Mail SMTP (for using SMTP in site)

**!About the 3., I decided to set only the option "Cash on Delivery" to avoid any illegal issues (in case someone ignores the notification messages and passes their credit card to the site).
!!About the 5: Because the free InfinityFree account doesn't support email sending and provides a subdomain for hosting, so I use Gmail accounts for SMTP support on the site (I set the app key in Gmail and use the key's data in WP Mail SMTP).**

I develop sites using WordPress at zero cost to improve my portfolio as a developer. In continue, presents the summary of each website.

## 1. PowerPro Gym
As is obvious, the PowerPro Gym refers to a hypothetical Gym in Thessalonikis' center. It's a simple site that has 3 pages: The Home Page, the FAQ page, and the Blog. The links don't work because the site is about a hypothetical gym.

## 2. GeorgeSuits
The George Suits refers to a hypothetical men's suits store in Thessaloniki.  It's a completely functional eShop, so have a Collection page, a Privacy Policy, a Blog, a Cart page, a Contact page, and additionally have a Copyright page (the link is to the footer's bottom) where I explain what tools and the logic I used during building this eShop). The Social Media buttons drive in my GitHub page because GeorgeSuits is not a real place, and the address was selected randomly.
